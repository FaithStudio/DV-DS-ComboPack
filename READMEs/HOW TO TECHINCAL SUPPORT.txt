Q: OMFG! Help me, my HP/Armor, Dodge/Death-Resist/ArmorAb values, & Ammo Counters on the full-screen HUD are blown up and look nothing like advertised! Y u do dis? Dis sucks! >:E
A: *sighs* Sorry about that folks. Appearantly I forgot that I use a different "hud_scale" value than most mods do [this is a console-typed command]. Most people will have it set to 1 [or TRUE]. DV-DS's HUD currently relies on it being 0 [or FALSE]. Set it to 0 and it should look right, but be warned when you exit to change it back to 1 if you're gonna play some other mods seeing as that the HUDs in THOSE wads will probably look funky if you don't. >.>
A2: Gonna see if I can change that later. I honestly forgot about this being a thing because I've had "hud_scale" set to 0/FALSE for such a long time I forgot about it until recently. :\


Q: Why do I see "??? (puke 806 [0-9])" a bunch of times on the right side of my screen? Such clutter, much dumb. >:(
A: The way ZDoom decides to show unbound commands with printed-messages is weird, hence it shows the script commands (or things like "+use" if the USE key is unbound and the bind for it is displayed on screen for example) that the binds execute when they're not bound. To change this, just bind keys to the "(Assign/Cast) QuickSpell [1-10]" in the "Customize Controls" menu [the commands are near the bottom of the controls], and they'll actually show the "KEY" being used instead of the command. I would personally perfer the 0-9 keys on the numpad if available, but that's up to you to decide. For more info on how to quickspell, refer to the proper text file about it. :P
A2: Also, there will be a similar issue when you start seeing that you have Aeon Points [usually by default you won't see them until you reach level 32, but the special DV-DS options can change it to an earlier level or to always see and use Aeon Points], where it'll tell you the keys to use to cycle up/down stats to put them into, and to actually use them. The same weird thing applies. And of course, there's commands for this in the "Customize Controls" menu. I use B, N and M myself, but you don't have to, whatever you feel best suits you. :P
