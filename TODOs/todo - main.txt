Major Things:

- Revise Summon Spells to actually be USEFUL again. This is one of the oldest and least modified things from the original DoomSpell right now, and summons probably are at best good only for distractions right now since they don't get map & skill based bonuses to their stats. Not sure if I'll make them supported by Spreader Aura and whatnot yet, or how I might even try to approach that. :P [in progress]

- Redo Poison Clouds so they don't use ACS for their dispersal effect and so that they can be vertically aimed. :P [done]

- Possibly Make "Hades Elemental Eye/Soul" and "Hades Overlord Eye/Soul" as Hellcore weapons?
- Better QuickSpell access [use only one key per slot (set/remove/cast) instead of 3 for each slot] :P
- Find a damn sprite artist for character sprites, weapons, bosses, etc. :P
-- Proper Flora player-sprites.
-- Proper Diaris Bow weapon sprites [so it doesn't look like a copy of Kissa's bow in Chosen <.<]
-- Maybe player sprites of Illucia with a crewcut [for DVI, where lore states her hair is close shaved, compared to DVII where it's grown out similar to her current sprites]
- Get the boss monsters for DVII's part of the game started [aka WK, StW, Sm, LsSa, CoH, DrB, AF & Sa].
- Find a way to get DV2M06 & DV2M08 converted to UDMF format. >.>;
- Get Flora's unique spells set up for her [the DQ-Style spells, etc] & Revise the SpellID lists as well [aka making new spells easier to add, hahah >.>].
- Get a buffs/debuffs system available for players and monsters [beyond the current spell-induced buffs]

Moderate or Less Important Things:
- Get some art commissioned from ProfessorMegaman for Deggaris and Illucia for things like Character Help Screens or general showy-stuff :P
- Considering a 'Boots' system for Deggaris and Illucia to help bolster their dodge rates a bit, maybe other things like chance not to incure damagefloor-damage, etc.
- Maybe introduce more guns [and/or gun upgrades(mod packs, something?)] for Deggaris and Illucia so they don't fall TOO far behind Flora in damage output in later levels. :P
- Create an 'aura' to represent someone when under the effect of Divine Avatar, or other auras for specfic buffs/debuffs.

Possible Considerations:
- MAYBE convert from ACS to DoomScript sometime... maybe? <.<;

Bugfixes:
- Stop Hades Elementals/Overlords from showing up in DV1's segment of the game. :P
- Alternatively, add an option to allow/disallow DVII-unique monsters to appear in DVI maps. >.>;
