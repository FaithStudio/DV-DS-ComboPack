I revamped the quickspell system recently. Instead of fifteen buttons for five different slots, it's now ten buttons for ten slots, in other worlds, 1:1 instead of 3:1.

 To understand how to Cast/Assign/Clear a spell from a specfic slot, just remember this:
 -- Hitting the quickslot's button on it's own casts the spell in that slot [provided you can afford it].
 -- Holding down "RUN [TOGGLE]" and hitting the respective quickslot button will assign your currently selected main spell to that slot.
 -- Holding down "RELOAD" and hitting the respective quickslot button will clear that slot of any spell that was assigned to it.

Just remember your RUN and RELOAD keys and how to combine them with the correct quickslot keys, and you'll get the hang of the system, hopefully. :P
