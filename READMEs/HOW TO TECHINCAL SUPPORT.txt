Q: OMFG! Help me, my HP/Armor, Dodge/Death-Resist/ArmorAb values, & Ammo Counters on the full-screen HUD are blown up and look nothing like advertised! Y u do dis? Dis sucks! >:E
A: *sighs* Sorry about that folks. Appearantly I forgot that I use a different "hud_scale" value than most mods do [this is a console-typed command]. Most people will have it set to 1 [or TRUE]. DV-DS's HUD currently relies on it being 0 [or FALSE]. Set it to 0 and it should look right, but be warned when you exit to change it back to 1 if you're gonna play some other mods seeing as that the HUDs in THOSE wads will probably look funky if you don't. >.>
A2: Gonna see if I can change that later. I honestly forgot about this being a thing because I've had "Hud_Scale" set to 0/FALSE for such a long time I forgot about it until recently. :\
