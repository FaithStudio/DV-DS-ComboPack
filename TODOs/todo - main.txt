Major Things:

- Revamp how Stealth Monsters work. [in progress]

- Make either a 'weapon' or something akin to a 'taunt' to allow the player to awaken all monsters in an area/map with guarantee [especially when playing as Flora, where most of her weapons have little if any chance to alert enemies, which makes mapsets like Going Down really easy at times, or even breaks the flow of gameplay entirely. :P]
- Find a damn sprite artist for character sprites, weapons, bosses, etc. :P
-- Proper Flora player-sprites.
-- Proper Diaris Bow weapon sprites [so it doesn't look like a copy of Kissa's bow in Chosen <.<]
-- Maybe get player sprites of Illucia with a crewcut [for DVI, where lore states her hair is close-shaved, compared to DVII where it's grown out similar to her current sprites]
- Get the boss monsters for DVII's part of the game started [aka WK, StW, Sm, LsSa, CoH, DrB, AF & Sa].
- Find a way to get DV2M06 & DV2M08 converted to UDMF format. >.>;
- Get Flora's unique spells set up for her [the DQ-Style spells, etc] & Revise the SpellID lists as well [aka making new spells easier to add, hahah >.>].
- Get a buffs/debuffs system available for players and monsters [beyond the current spell-induced buffs]

Moderate or Less Important Things:
- Get some art commissioned from ProfessorMegaman for Deggaris and Illucia for things like Character Help Screens or general showy-stuff :P
- Considering a 'Boots' system for Deggaris and Illucia to help bolster their dodge rates a bit, maybe other things like chance not to incure damagefloor-damage, etc.
- Maybe introduce more guns [and/or gun upgrades(mod packs, something?)] for Deggaris and Illucia so they don't fall TOO far behind Flora in damage output in later levels. :P
- Create an 'aura' to represent someone when under the effect of Divine Avatar, or other auras for specfic buffs/debuffs.

Possible Considerations:
- Possibly Make "Hades Elemental Eye/Soul" and "Hades Overlord Eye/Soul" as Hellcore weapons?
- Add ailments/buffs system [for inflicting on enemies and players]
- Incorporate Dash/Dodging Mechanics
- MAYBE convert from ACS to DoomScript sometime... maybe? <.<;
- Heretic Support[?]
- Hexen Support[?]
- Strife Support[?]

Bugfixes:
- Stop Hades Elementals/Overlords from showing up in DV1's segment of the game. :P
- Alternatively, add an option to allow/disallow DVII-unique monsters to appear in DVI maps. >.>;
