Figured I'd added the ORIGINAL DoomSpellV2.rar for historical reasons. This is the base, original mod that this developed from. :P

Also a "Folder-load" version that removes the copies of the Doom2 maps, and adds the LOADACS lump [the maps had behavior lumps in order to load the script files before, which is why they were even there, since I guess LOADACS didn't exist back at the time?], and is loadable as a folder instead of a wad, so it can be played with other less-modded Doom 2 maps. :V

The original mod is from BEFORE 2010, so it's been around about as long as ZDoom itself. :P
