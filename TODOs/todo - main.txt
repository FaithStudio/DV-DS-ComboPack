Major Things:

-- [TODO: Need to find a way to directly detect when damage inflicted was enough to otherwise kill you]
- Find a damn sprite artist for character sprites, weapons, bosses, etc. :P
-- Proper graphics for individual melee attacks (in progress, Sgt. Shivers has made Flora's punching and gauntlet-punching sprites, is working on the kick attack, maybe <.<)
-- Proper Flora player-sprites.
-- Proper Diaris Bow weapon sprites [so it doesn't look like a copy of Kissa's bow in Chosen <.<]
-- Maybe get player sprites of Illucia with a crewcut [for DVI, where lore states her hair is close-shaved, compared to DVII where it's grown out similar to her current sprites]
- Get the boss monsters for DVII's part of the game started [aka WK, StW, Sm, LsSa, CoH, DrB, AF & Sa].
- Find a way to get DV2M06 & DV2M08 converted to UDMF format. >.>;
- Get Flora's unique spells set up for her [the DQ-Style spells, etc] & Revise the SpellID lists as well [aka making new spells easier to add, hahah >.>].
- Get a buffs/debuffs system available for players and monsters [beyond the current spell-induced buffs]
-- Regen [Buff] (gain HP to to 100%/200% depending on level)
- Point-based Perks system [gain points at level up, would be done in a menu]
-- Both shared and individual stuff for each of the three characters 
--- Bullet/Pellet, Plasma and Rocket Damage increase perks [or make each time possibly inflict debuffs, etc] for Deggaris/Illucia
-- Might even include moving some currently accessible-from-the-start abilities to perks (dashing, different levels of Tension)
-- etc

Moderate or Less Important Things:
- Get some art commissioned from ProfessorMegaman for Deggaris and Illucia for things like Character Help Screens or general showy-stuff :P
- Considering a 'Boots' system for Deggaris and Illucia to help bolster their dodge rates a bit, maybe other things like chance not to incure damagefloor-damage, etc.
- Maybe introduce more guns [and/or gun upgrades(mod packs, something?)] for Deggaris and Illucia so they don't fall TOO far behind Flora in damage output in later levels. :P
- Create an 'aura' to represent someone when under the effect of Divine Avatar, or other auras for specfic buffs/debuffs.

Possible Considerations:
- Possibly Make "Hades Elemental Eye/Soul" and "Hades Overlord Eye/Soul" as Hellcore weapons?
- Add ailments/buffs system [for inflicting on enemies and players]
- MAYBE convert from ACS to GDCC sometime... maybe? <.<;
- Heretic Support[?]
- Hexen Support[?]
- Strife Support[?]
- Find a way to properly denote when a critical hit has been inflicted by the player [via sound and/or damage-number cues].
-- IDEA: Attempt to make attacks 'give' an inventory item to a monsters for the damage-indicator script to search for to do the expanded sized numbers and crit-sound. 
--- [problem is A_RadiusGive is borky as balls with actual distances compared to A_Explode (has to be like 32+ to even work, and MM particles still don't really even work with THIS), though using +HITTRACER in combo with AAPTR_TRACER for A_GiveInventory works for direct hits)

Bugfixes:
- Stop Hades Elementals/Overlords from showing up in DV1's segment of the game. :P
- Alternatively, add an option to allow/disallow DVII-unique monsters to appear in DVI maps. >.>;
