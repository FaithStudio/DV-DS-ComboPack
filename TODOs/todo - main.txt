- Spreader Powerup [to show up in place sometimes of Blur Spheres and Invulnerability Spheres, especially more on Deggaris and Illucia's playthroughs]
- Possibly Make "Hades Elemental Eye/Soul" and "Hades Overlord Eye/Soul" as Hellcore weapons?
- Better QuickSpell access [use only one key per slot (set/remove/cast) instead of 3 for each slot] :P
- Find a damn sprite artist for character sprites, weapons, bosses, etc. :P
-- Proper Flora player-sprites.
-- Proper Diaris Bow weapon sprites [so it doesn't look like a copy of Kissa's bow in Chosen <.<]
-- Maybe player sprites of Illucia with a crewcut [for DVI, where lore states her hair is close shaved, compared to DVII where it's grown out similar to her current sprites]
- Get the boss monsters for DVII's part of the game started [aka WK, StW, Sm, LsSa, CoH, DrB, AF & Sa].
- Find a way to get DV2M06 & DV2M08 converted to UDMF format. >.>;
- Get Flora's unique spells set up for her [the DQ-Style spells, etc] & Revise the SpellID lists as well [aka making new spells easier to add, hahah >.>].
- Get a buffs/debuffs system available for players and monsters [beyond the current spell-induced buffs]

Moderate or Less Important Things:
- Get some art commissioned from ProfessorMegaman for Deggaris and Illucia for things like Character Help Screens or general showy-stuff :P
- Considering a 'Boots' system for Deggaris and Illucia to help bolster their dodge rates a bit, maybe other things like chance not to incure damagefloor-damage, etc.
- Maybe introduce more guns [and/or gun upgrades(mod packs, something?)] for Deggaris and Illucia so they don't fall TOO far behind Flora in damage output in later levels. :P
- Create an 'aura' to represent someone when under the effect of Divine Avatar, or other auras for specfic buffs/debuffs.

Possible Considerations:
- MAYBE convert from ACS to DoomScript sometime... maybe? <.<;

Bugfixes:
- Stop Hades Elementals/Overlords from showing up in DV1's segment of the game. :P
- Alternatively, add an option to allow/disallow DVII-unique monsters to appear in DVI maps. >.>;
