--Create the Actual Abilties [Lv1 & Lv2] as Usable Spells

- Find a damn sprite artist for character sprites, weapons, bosses, etc. :P
-- Proper Flora player-sprites.
-- Proper Diaris Bow weapon sprites [so it doesn't look like a copy of Kissa's bow in Chosen <.<]
-- Maybe player sprites of Illucia with a crewcut [for DVI, where lore states her hair is close shaved, compared to DVII where it's grown out similar to her current sprites]
- Get the boss monsters for DVII's part of the game started.
- Find a way to get DVII-MAP06 & DVII-MAP08 converted to UDMF format. >.>;
- Get Flora's unique spells set up for her [the DQ-Style spells, etc]
- Get a buffs/debuffs system available for players and monsters [beyond the current spell-induced buffs]

Moderate or Less Important Things:
- Get some art commissioned from ProfessorMegaman for Deggaris and Illucia for things like Character Help Screens or general showy-stuff :P
- Considering a 'Boots' system for Deggaris and Illucia to help bolster their dodge rates a bit, maybe other things like chance not to incure damagefloor-damage, etc.
- Maybe introduce more guns [and/or gun upgrades(mod packs, something?)] for Deggaris and Illucia so they don't fall TOO far behind Flora in damage output in later levels. :P
- Create an 'aura' to represent someone when under the effect of Divine Avatar, or other auras for specfic buffs/debuffs.

Possible Considerations:
- MAYBE convert from ACS to DoomScript sometime... maybe? <.<;

Bugfixes:
- Prevent Deggaris/Illucia from being able to pick up or carry 'Hellcore'-class weapons. x.x [thanks to SeriousCacodemon for discovering this bug too]
- Stop Hades Elementals/Overlords from showing up in DV1's segment of the game. :P
- Alternatively, add an option to allow/disallow DVII-unique monsters to appear in DVI maps. >.>;
