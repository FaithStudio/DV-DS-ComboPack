DV-DS-ComboPack [Deus Vult Doomspell Edition Combination Package]

- Includes modified [harder] mapsets for Deus Vult I and Deus Vult II (multiplayer-only monsters are now single-player used) and with a few new in-level scripts, and even a few 'bosses' [things worse than Cyberdemons I mean].
- Can also be ran with Classic Doom 1 & Doom 2 [including TNT, Plutonia, and many megawads designed for both, but not all will work perfectly, and some might not work at all, use with certain megawads at your own discretion].
- Three character classes. Although two of them are basically magic-wielding Marine-type characters with different stat growths.
- The third is an unique mage-like class with a surprisingly powerful melee weapon, causing you to measure risk for reward for putting a 'glass cannon' at close range with monsters.
- RPG mechanics included. Experience points, magic spells, various statistics, variable enemy strengths based on game-wide progress or difficulty level, a 'Psyche Up' mechanic to temporarily make your character stronger in bursts for special situations, etc.
- Monsters can occasionally 'evolve' into stronger versions of their general species, and/or become mostly invisible to the player [although it's not ZDoom-style stealth outright (not anymore)]
